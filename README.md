Daily Update:

â€¢ `03/18/2024`
  - Already Created UI (Electron.js)
  - Tried to develop a code for conversion of pdf to excel 
    (Found lots of python libraries but not accurate, found API accurate but must be paid).
  - Managed to develop a code for splitting PDF Pages.
  - Managed to develop a code for Merging PDF pages.
  - Next Plan - Switch to nodejs because python doesnt auto install libraries/modules when electronjs is packaged/built.
